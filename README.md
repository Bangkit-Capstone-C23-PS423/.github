<h2>An Calorie Logging App for Bangkit Capstone Project 2023</h2>
<h1></h1>
<p>Hi. this is our repository for our project in capstone project Bangkit 2023. Our team consist of 6 people from Machine Learning Path, Mobile Development Path and Cloud Computing Path.

All of the project management we take a place with Github repository, to distinguish each path we create a repository in each team member Github Repository.</p>

## Simple Description About Our Project
### Machine Learning
In this project, we created a calorie logging app with two main features: food object recognition and food recommendation features. 
For food object recognition, we use the TensorFlow Object Detection base which is able to recognize food objects as follows.
1. Apple
2. Banana
3. Bread
4. Egg
5. Bun
6. Pear
7. Litchi
8. Orange
9. Qiwi
10. Tomato
11. Sachima
12. Fire Dough Twist
13. Grape
14. Mango
15. Lemon
16. Mooncake
17. Peach
18. Plum
19. Doughnut

For recommendation features, Amazon Fine Food Reviews been used as dataset for training the recommendation model. This dataset contain information about :
Reviews from Oct 1999 - Oct 2012
- 568,454 reviews
- 256,059 users
- 74,258 products
- 260 users with > 50 reviews

### Mobile Development 
In this project, mobile development using Kotlin to develop all in the application. In this project there are 2 main contributors who are also students from the learning path mobile development. below is a main features of our application:
- Login & Registration User
- Food object recognition with cameraX

### Cloud Computing
Cloud Computing in here as backend services to connect from machine learning model and mobile development with android platform, below is the infrastructure of cloud computing:
- Google Cloud Platform
- Firebase
- Cloud Run
- Cloud Storage
- Cloud SQL
